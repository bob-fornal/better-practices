This guide is heavily influenced by John Papa's amazing respositories for AngularJS and Angular ([HERE](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide)).

## Why "Better Practices"

I've avoided best practices in the title here on the assumption that these will evolve and change over time. There is no "best practices" that should always be used.

## Purpose

*Opinionated better practices guide for teams by [@rfornal](https://twitter.com/rfornal)*.

If you are looking for an opinionated better practices guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring in code, then step right in. These are based on my development experience and working with various teams.

The purpose of this guide is to provide guidance on building applications by showing the conventions I use and, more importantly, why I choose them.

Use this guide. Attributions are appreciated.
