# Better Practices

## Categories

1. [Angular](/Angular/README.md)

## Influence

This guide is heavily influenced by John Papa's amazing respositories for AngularJS and Angular ([HERE]()https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).

## Purpose

*Opinionated better practices guide for teams by [@rfornal](https://twitter.com/rfornal)*.

If you are looking for an opinionated better practices guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring in code, then step right in. These are based on my development experience and working with various teams.

The purpose of this guide is to provide guidance on building applications by showing the conventions I use and, more importantly, why I choose them.

## Contributing

Open an issue first to discuss potential changes/additions. If you have questions with the guide, feel free to leave them as issues in the repository. If you find a typo, create a pull request. The idea is to keep the content up to date and use github’s native feature to help tell the story with issues and PR’s, which are all searchable via google. Why? Because odds are if you have a question, someone else does too! You can learn more here at about how to contribute.

By contributing to this repository you are agreeing to make your content available subject to the license of this repository.

## Process

```
1. Discuss the changes in a GitHub issue.
2. Open a Pull Request, reference the issue, and explain the change and why it adds value.
3. The Pull Request will be evaluated and either merged or declined.
```
